Speedcubing is something you've probably never heard of unless you've stumbled
across it on social media or YouTube. It is the 'sport' of solving a Rubik's
cube as fast as possible, and what started as a quirky hobby in the 1980s has
evolved into a legitimate competitive pursuit with official world records,
international competitions, and a rapidly growing global community.

## The Current State of Speedcubing

Currently, the world record stands at an incredible 3.05 seconds, set by Xuanyi
Geng in April 2025 at the age of just 7 years old. Yes, you read that correctly,
a 7-year-old has managed, in three seconds, to solve the puzzle that was once
thought impossible.

## The Evolution of Methods

What makes speedcubing fascinating is the evolution of solving methods.
Beginners typically start with the layer-by-layer method, which can take several
minutes. Advanced speedcubers use methods like CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) or
Roux, which involve memorizing sequences of moves called algorithms that
manipulate specific pieces without disturbing others.

The best cubers in the world have internalized these algorithms to the point
where their fingers execute them without conscious thought. It's muscle memory
taken to an extreme level, combined with exceptional spatial reasoning and the
ability to plan multiple steps ahead during inspection time.

Xuanyi Geng, the current record holder in the video above uses the cutting edge
[ZB Method](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/ZB_method) which
requires the memorization of 798 alrigotithms, aonother feat thought impossible
just a few years ago.

## The Community and Competitions

The World Cube Association (WCA) oversees official speedcubing competitions
worldwide, ensuring standardized rules and equipment. These competitions aren't
just about the classic 3x3x3 cube. There are events for 2x2x2, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, and
even up to 7x7x7 cubes. There are also one-handed solving, blindfolded solving,
and "fewest moves" challenges, along with non-cube events such as the Megaminx
(a dodecahedron), and pyraminx (a tetrahedron).

What's remarkable about the speedcubing community is how supportive and
welcoming it is. Despite the competitive nature of the sport, cubers freely
share techniques, algorithms, and tips. It's a community driven by collective
improvement and a shared passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in trying speedcubing yourself, the barrier to entry is
surprisingly low. You'll need any Rubik's Cube (though I would reccomend a cheap
speedcube that you can find for under $10), and there are countless free
tutorials online. With a bit of practice, most people can get their times under
a minute within a few weeks.

Will you ever reach 3.05 seconds? Probably not. But that's not really the point.
Speedcubing is about personal improvement, the satisfaction of executing a
smooth solve, and joining a community of people who find joy in this unique
challenge.
